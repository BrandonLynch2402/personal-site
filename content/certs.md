## LPI Linux Essentials

The LPI Linux Essentials exams tests your ability to configure and administer a Linux
operating system at a basic level. I used the NDG Linux Essentials course on
[netacad](https://www.netacad.com/courses/os-it/ndg-linux-essentials) along with using
Linux daily as preperation for the exam. After passing the Cisco DevNet Associate exam,
I learned a lot about Linux, which put me in a great position to take this exam and
created my love for Linux at the same time.

## Cisco DevNet Associate

The Cisco DevNet Associate exam tests your ability to effectively implement automation within a network.
Some of the topics covered in the exam include CI/CD, APIs, Python, and much more.
I used the DevNet course on [CBT Nuggets](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/cisco/devnet-associate)
and lots of hands-on practice to prepare for the exam. My knowledge of networking and previous
programming skills allowed me to more easily jump into network automation. It's the future.

## Microsoft Technology Associate 98-383

The MTA 98-383 exam tests your ability to develop basic websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I took this exam as a part of a course at North Technical High School. Originally, I wanted
to become a web developer, but this was before I knew about the rest of the IT field. The
skills I learned from basic web developement have proven to be very valuable, and it propelled
me towards other fields in IT. Everyone has to start somewhere, and I'm glad I
started here.
