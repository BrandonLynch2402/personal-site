I'm currently a senior attending North Technical High School.
I have a strong passion for IT (networking and Linux are my
favorites at the moment) and I love learning.

My interest in technology started by building PCs and tinkering with
software and operating systems when I was younger. After that,
I just kept going. Around sophmore year of high school, I was
seriously starting to learn web development. This is what I wanted
to do as a career at the time. I used [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org),
which I believe is one of the best tools for learning web development.
While learning so much on my own, I realized that I could learn anything
I set out to. This only sparked my interest in other topics, and I wanted to
learn more and more. Eventually, I found myself attending the Cisco
Networking Academy. This is where I definitely found my passion in IT.

Right now, I'm studying to pass the Cisco Certified Networking Associate
(CCNA) exam. Along with that, I just want to learn as much as I can, while
also preparing myself for a career in IT.

My goal is to get a job in IT right after school (which is very soon).
I'm very excited to start working in the field, gaining real-world
experience, and further developing my own technical skills.
