I am a senior at North Technical High School.
I have a strong passion for IT and cybersecurity, and I love learning.

My interest in technology started when I was young. I was fascinated
with building PCs and tinkering with things until they broke. Luckily,
I was able to fix them. While in high school, I started to mess around
with a wide array of different technologies, but it all lead to
cybersecurity. First, I wanted to become a web developer. Turns out that
wasn't for me. Then, I wanted to become a network engineer. I still like
networking a lot, but there is something more interesting to me. And that
is cybersecurity. All of the skills that I had learned over the years set
me up perfectly to get into security.

Right now, I am continuing to study, practice, and work towards my goals.
I'm painfully waiting until the day I graduate high school so I can
really get out there and start working.

My goal is to get a job in IT right after school. I'm very excited to start
working in the field, gaining real-world experience, and further developing
my skills.
